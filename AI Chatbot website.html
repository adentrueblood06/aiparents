Another way to form healthy relationships is by creating boundaries, so you do not upset your friends or family by making them think youâ€™re untrustworthy. This goes both ways because you have to create boundaries too and let people know what bothers you. These boundaries led to trust in relationships making them better and healthier. The final reason why healthy relationships are important is that people in them tend to be in a happier place of mind and are not constantly stressing out because they have someone in their lives, they trust.');

The first step would be creating a budget so you use your money wisely and do not spend on unnecessary things. Secondly, you should put money into a savings account every paycheck so you do not need to take it out of your checking account if unexpected expenses pop up. Thirdly, when you take out loans make sure to pay them back on time so you do not have to worry about paying it back at a higher interest rate. Make sure to keep track of your credit score because you do not want a bad credit score because lenders will see you as a risk.');
